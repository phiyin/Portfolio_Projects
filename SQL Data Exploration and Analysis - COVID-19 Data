*****The ENTIRE DATASET at a GLANCE*****

Select *
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 3,4

*****************************************

-- These are the following steps taken in EXPLORING the data set:
--1. Death Analysis
--2. Death Analysis by Country
--3. Death Analysis by Continent
--4. Global Death Analysis
--5. Vaccination Analysis
--6. Creating Views

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ***** DEATH ANALYSIS *****

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 1,2

-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows your chances of survival or otherwise upon contracting COVID-19 based on individual countries
-- Nigeria is a choice country

Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%igeri%'
and continent is not null 
order by 1,2

-- ***** DEATH ANALYIS BY COUNTRY *****
-- Total Cases vs Population
-- Shows what percentage of population that got infected with Covid

Select Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%igeri%'
order by 1,2


-- Countries with Highest Infection Rate Ever in comparison to their Population in Descending Order

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

Select location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- ***** DEATH ANALYIS BY CONTINENT *****

-- Showing contintents with the highest death count per population

Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- Continents with their various constituent countries showing the highest count per population

Select continent, location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent, location
order by continent desc, TotalDeathCount desc


-- ***** GLOBAL DEATH ANALYIS *****

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
where continent is not null 


-- ***** VACCINATION ANALYIS *****

-- Total Population vs Vaccinations
-- Shows Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(convert(bigint,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
order by 2,3



-- Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
-- Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

With PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(bigint,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 as PercentPopulationVaccinated
From PopvsVac



-- Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

DROP Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
Continent nvarchar(255),
Location nvarchar(255),
Date datetime,
Population numeric,
New_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

Insert into #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(bigint,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date

Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 as PercentPopulationVaccinated
From #PercentPopulationVaccinated

***** CREATING VIEWS ******

-- Creating View to store data for later visualizations

Create View PercentPopulationVaccinated as
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 

Create View TotalDeathCount as
Select continent, location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProjectcovid..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent, location
--order by continent desc, TotalDeathCount desc
